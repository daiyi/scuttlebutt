scuttlebutt
===========
javascript visual novel engine.

I guess I'm working on this again!

### demo
Best explained by [an example](http://daiyiwhale.github.io/scuttlebutt/).

### how to story
We've made a language in which story scripts are written, as documented [here](https://github.com/daiyiwhale/scuttlebutt/wiki/Language). Lots of feedback on ease of use, human readability, etc would be appreciated!

### support
