scuttlebutt
===========
jquery visual novel engine 

### example story
[here!](http://daiyiwhale.github.io/scuttlebutt/) should usually be working :'D

### how to story
We've made a language in which story scripts are written, as documented [here](https://github.com/daiyiwhale/scuttlebutt/wiki/Language). Lots of feedback on ease of use, human readability, etc would be appreciated!

### download

The latest working version is in the gh-pages branch, and master is the development branch. This is probably the worst workflow ever but :'DD 

### support
hahahahahahahahaha ha ha hahaha ha
