            "text": "Hello, and thank you for purchasing Cyberpolis. <p> We hope that you will enjoy the newest and finest game that technology has to offer. <p> The system has undergone some upgrades with the coming of the new ERA. In light of some of the bugs that the game has recently undergone, extra care has been taken to ensure the safety and security of our users. As always, some errors have been fixed and patches have been installed. <p> For instance, the sun in Winwintar is no longer a giant disco ball, and the class description of Bards no longer reads ‘when the pimp’s in the crib ma, drop it like it’s hot’. <p> However, the biggest changes come in the form of the technology used to play Cyberpolis.  <p> With our latest VR immersion system, you will now be able to touch, taste, smell, hear, and live the game as though it were real life itself. Cyberpolis is now almost indistinguishable from the real world, allowing you to live out your greatest fantasies and to roleplay a second life.  <p> Thank you once again for choosing to play Cyberpolis. We are certain you will enjoy your stay.",

If you were close enough to a whale to see its hair you would probably be too concerned with your structural integrity to appreciate it though. ",
